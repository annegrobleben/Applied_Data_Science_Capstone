This repository includes the notebook that were created as part of the capstone project for the IBM Professional Certificate in Data Science. In this Capstone project Company “Space Y” is the fictional competitor of SpaceX. 
As SpaceY we are investigating the Falcon9 launches from SpaceX in order to determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Depending on whether the first stage is successful or not, costs for the launch will be lower or higher. 
Therefore, the launch outcome is important to know if we want to bid against SpaceX. The most important question we need to answer is: How can we predict the outcome of a Falcon9 launch? 

Summary of methodologies
- Data Collection from Spacex API and webscraping from Wikipedia
- Data wrangling
- EDA using SQL and visualization
- Interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly dash
- Predictive analysis using classification models 

Summary of all results
- Using a logistic regression model, a K Nearest Neighbors model, a Support Vector Machine model or a Decision Tree we are able to predict the Falcon 9 launch outcomes with an accuracy of 0.83334.
